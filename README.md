# Ocean Acidification: A Chemistry Simulation

This interactive simulation demonstrates how oceans acidify in response to changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Beginning in the simulation's Sequential mode, users can observe six chemical reactions which, when the system is in equilibrium, cancel each other out. In Continuous mode, users can create disequilibrium by adjusting the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide and observing the effects of this change on ocean acidity.
